Twitter makes money in two ways: advertising and data licensing. In 2021, Twitter generated $4.5 billion from advertising and $570 million from data licensing. While Twitter generated $5 billion in total revenues, it lost 221 million. In April 2022, Elon Musk tried to take over Twitter for about $44 billion. 

Twitter revenue model explained
Twitter generates revenues via Advertising and data licensing.

Twitter Advertising Services
Twitter generates most of its advertising revenue by selling Promoted Products that consist of the following:

Promoted Tweets revenue stream
Labeled as “promoted,” it appears within a user’s timeline, search results, or profile pages just like an ordinary Tweet regardless of device, whether desktop or mobile.

Using its proprietary algorithms, Twitter tries to understand the interests of each user and deliver Promoted Tweets that are intended to be relevant to a particular user.

Promoted Tweets are pay-for-performance or pay-for-impression, priced through an auction.

Promoted accounts revenue stream
Promoted Accounts, labeled as “promoted,” provide a way for advertisers to grow a community based on pay-for-performance advertising priced through an auction.

Promoted Trends
Promoted Trends, labeled as “promoted,” appear at the top of the list of trending topics or timelines for an entire day in a particular country or globally.

Promoted Trends are sold on a fixed-fee-per-day basis.

Data Licensing and Other
Data licensing and other revenues comprise:

Data licensing revenue stream
That allows data partners to access, search and analyze historical and real-time data on the platform consisting of public Tweets and their content.

Twitter MoPub exchange revenue stream
This is a mobile ad exchange where Twitter receives service fees from transactions completed on the exchange.

In short, this is a marketplace where buyers and sellers purchase and sell advertising inventory. Thus, it matches buyers and sellers.

Twitter Blue
That is an opt-in, paid monthly subscription, which, before Elon Musk took over the company, comprised a set of minor additional features compared to regular Tweet.

It was then re-labeled as a subscription service, enabling users to get the blue checkmark on the account that had been verified. 

In the past, the blue checkmark was assigned to active, notable, and authentic accounts of public interest. 

With Twitter Blue, accounts could get the blue checkmark for $7.99/month in the US. 

How big is Twitter’s advertising business?
In 2021 the company made over $4.5 billion from advertising services alone.

Also, if we compare those numbers with Google and Facebook advertising revenues, we can understand the proportion of Twitter digital advertising cake back in 2021.

Each company has a few critical metrics to monitor daily, weekly, and monthly.

Those are the metrics Twitter looks at for the success of its business:

The change in metrics, such as monthly and daily active users and change in ad engagement, can cause the business.

User growth trends reflected in the MAUs, changes in DAUs and monetization trends reflected in advertising engagements are vital factors that affect Twitter revenues.

How does Twitter spend its money?
To keep the technical infrastructure up and running, the company spends money in data centers for co-located facilities, lease and hosting costs, and traffic acquisition expenses (to enable the advertisement placed on Twitter to be shown on third-party publishers’ websites).

The company spent over $1.1 billion in 2019 (33% of its revenues).

Twitter also spends money on product development, engineering, and research to keep the whole infrastructure and company evolving.

In 2019, Twitter spent $680 million on R&D.

Twitter also spent over $900 million (26% of its revenues) on sales and marketing. And in sales and marketing activities.
